# ROFLSwap Exchange System Demo Script

## Introduction

"Today I'll demonstrate the technical implementation of ROFLSwap, our DEX built on Oasis Sapphire."

## Technical Backend Architecture

"Now I'll explain a bit more about the backend and logic of our system. ROFLSwap's core is a confidential order matching engine running inside Sapphire's TEE environment with these components:

1. Client-side encryption (secp256k1 ECDH)
2. TEE-secured order book with tamper-proof execution
3. Deterministic matching algorithm using binary heaps
4. Atomic settlement with on-chain verification"

## Cryptographic Pipeline

"Our cryptographic pipeline implements threshold ECDH key exchange with Sapphire's attestation mechanisms to verify enclave integrity. Each order follows this workflow:

```
User → Encrypt(Order) → TEE → Match → Settlement → Blockchain
```

The SGX/TDX enclave provides hardware isolation ensuring neither we nor validators can access unencrypted order data."

## Order Matching Implementation

"Let's examine our matching implementation:"

```
python ordering.py
```

"The algorithm uses O(n log n) time complexity with these data structures:
- Red-black tree for order book management (O(log n) operations)
- Priority queue for price-time ordering
- Atomic execution logic for partial fills

Buy orders use max-heap sorting; sell orders use min-heap sorting. This enables efficient matching while maintaining strict price-time priority."

## Side-Channel Protection

"To prevent data leakage through side channels, we've implemented:
- Constant-time operations
- Memory-oblivious algorithms
- Uniform control flow paths
- Cache-line padding

This prevents timing attacks that might extract order information through execution patterns."

## Execution Logic

"The core matching process applies this algorithm:

```python
# Find compatible order pairs
matches = find_compatible_orders()

# For each match
for buy_order, sell_order in matches:
    # Calculate matched amount atomically
    matched_quantity = min(buy_order.remaining, sell_order.remaining)
    
    # Update order state with atomic operations
    execute_match(buy_order, sell_order, matched_quantity)
    
    # Generate settlement proof
    proof = generate_zk_settlement_proof(buy_order, sell_order, matched_quantity)
    
    # Submit to blockchain for verification
    submit_settlement(proof)
```

This ensures atomic execution even under high transaction volumes."

## Integration with Oasis ROFL

"Our integration with Oasis leverages ROFL for containerized TEE execution. The system components include:

1. ParaTime runtime for confidential execution
2. ROFL containers for enclave isolation
3. Remote attestation for verifiable execution
4. Encrypted state management"

## MEV Protection

"Our MEV protection employs:
1. Time-locked encryption with commit-reveal
2. Batch execution with intent separation
3. Zero-knowledge settlement proofs

These mechanisms create a cryptographic timelock preventing front-running by making it impossible to determine order content before execution."

## Performance Optimizations

"The production system implements:
- Lock-free concurrent data structures
- Memory-aligned order storage
- IO-optimal price level indexing
- Batched settlement transactions

These optimizations enable 100K+ orders/second with sub-millisecond latency."

## Demonstration and Example

"Let me show you how this works with a concrete example of the execution flow:

1. A user places an encrypted buy order for WATER at 0.053
2. Another user places an encrypted sell order for WATER at 0.051
3. The matching engine within the TEE identifies compatibility
4. The execution logic atomically updates order state
5. A settlement proof is generated and verified on-chain
6. Tokens are transferred between wallets"

## Conclusion

"This technical implementation creates a secure, efficient, and truly private trading environment. Our algorithm design and cryptographic architecture provide performance and security guarantees unmatched by traditional exchanges."
