# ROFLSwapOracle Implementation Fixes

This document outlines the fixes and improvements made to the ROFLSwapOracle implementation.

## Compiler Version Fixes

1. Updated Solidity version in contracts from 0.8.28 to 0.8.30:
   - Updated ROFLSwapOracle.sol
   - Updated PrivateERC20.sol
   - Updated hardhat.config.ts to match

## Configuration and Setup Improvements

1. Created the necessary directory structure for the ROFL app:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ../rofl_app/abi
   ```

2. Generated and copied the correct ABI to the ROFL app:
   ```bash
   jq '.abi' ./artifacts/contracts/ROFLSwapOracle.sol/ROFLSwapOracle.json > ../rofl_app/abi/ROFLSwapOracle.json
   ```

3. Set proper permissions for scripts:
   ```bash
   chmod +x ../rofl_app/update_rofl_environment.sh
   chmod +x ../rofl_app/roflswap_oracle_matching.py
   ```

## Verification and Testing Tools

1. Created a verification script (`scripts/verify-oracle-setup.js`) to check:
   - Deployment information
   - ABI file existence and validity
   - Environment script configuration
   - Script permissions

2. Made the verification script robust against network connectivity issues

## Documentation

1. Created a comprehensive README with:
   - Project overview
   - Installation instructions
   - Deployment steps
   - Configuration guidelines
   - Testing procedures
   - Architecture overview
   - Troubleshooting tips

2. Detailed the fixes made in this document

## Next Steps

1. Test the full deployment process on Sapphire testnet
2. Run the ROFL matcher script in the TEE environment
3. Update the ROFL app ID if needed after app registration
4. Test the full order placement and matching flow

These changes ensure that the ROFLSwapOracle implementation is correctly set up and ready for use with the proper compiler version and configuration. The additional verification tools help troubleshoot any remaining issues.
